Kmailer
==========

Developed as a project in education (MSCD.CS3700), the Kmailer application is designed as a simple SMTP sender application which is capable of sending email messages using SMTP protocol to a specified server/recipient from a specified sender.  This simple application is not currently capable of authenticating to an SMTP server, so it assumes authentication will be granted automatically, or prior to running the application.
